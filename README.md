Facebook Homebrew Tap
=====================

This is a [Homebrew][brew] tap for formulae for software developed by Facebook.


Setup
-----

Using these formulae requires Homebrew, which in turn requires Xcode. If you
have not yet installed Homebrew, a quick summary is at the end of this
document.

Once homebrew is installed, simply run:

    brew tap facebook/fb

Some of these formulae may require OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) or higher.


Use
---

To install software, just use `brew install` with the name of the formula. You
may wish to run `brew update` before hand to get the latest version of the
formulae. For example, to install the latest version of the thrift compiler:

    brew update
    brew install fbthrift-compiler

or to install the Buck build system from the latest HEAD commit:

    brew install --HEAD buck

To upgrade software:

    brew update
    brew upgrade    # upgrade all software installed with Homebrew
    brew upgrade fbthrift-compiler   # update just the thrift compiler


Contributing
------------

Please file bug reports and feature requests as GitHub issues against the individual project, not this repository - however, we do accept pull requests here.

To do development on these formulae, first fork the repository on GitHub. Add
your fork as a remote to your local clone:

    cd $(brew --prefix)/Library/Taps/facebook/homebrew-fb
    git remote add me git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/homebrew-fb.git
    git fetch me

To propose changes, push to your fork (e.g. with `git push me +master`) and
submit pull request on GitHub.

If you do not work for Facebook, you will need to [submit a Contributor License
Agreement ("CLA")][cla]. You only need to do this once to work on any of
Facebook's open source projects.

We follow Homebrew's [standard coding style][style].


Appendix: overview of installing Homebrew
-----------------------------------------

The Homebrew developers suggest installing Homebrew at `/usr/local` to maximize
compatibility with existing software. To do so, follow the instructions on
[their website][brew].

This author prefers `/opt/homebrew`, finding that it works well enough in
practice and keeps a cleaner separation between other software which might use
`/usr/local`. To install at `/opt/homebrew`, you can use:

    sudo mkdir /opt/homebrew
    sudo chown `whoami` /opt/homebrew
    curl -sSLf -o homebrew-installer https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install
    perl -pi -e s,/usr/local,/opt/homebrew, homebrew-installer
    ruby homebrew-installer
    rm homebrew-installer
    echo '$PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
